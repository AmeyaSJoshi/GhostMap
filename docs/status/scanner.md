# Scanner Status

## Current state
- **S1 complete and verified on a physical iPhone.** The scanner Unity project,
  AR smoke-test scene, two-step iOS build pipeline and on-device diagnostics are
  in place, and the Task S1 physical-device test passes.
- `apps/scanner/` is a Unity 6000.3.24f1 project: `Packages/manifest.json`
  (AR Foundation 6.3.1, Apple ARKit XR Plugin 6.3.1, `com.ghostmap.shared`),
  `ProjectSettings`, `Assets/XR` XR Plug-in Management configuration,
  `Assets/GhostMap/Scanner/Scanner.unity`, runtime bootstrap, editor build
  scripts, and EditMode tests.
- Two device failures were found and fixed along the way, each with a distinct
  root cause. Both are recorded below and in their handoffs.

## Last verified commit
- `80b5a48` — verified on a real iPhone. Its scanner sources are byte-identical
  to `772ce05`; `80b5a48` changed only a handoff document.

## Physical-device verification — S1, passed
Observed on a real iPhone against the build produced from `80b5a48`:

- `Active loader: ARKitLoader`
- live camera passthrough works
- `Session` reaches `SessionTracking`
- `Not tracking reason: None`
- `XRInput: running`
- `Cam L` and `Cam W` position change as the phone moves
- camera rotation changes as the phone rotates
- `Cam moved` counter increases
- detected plane count goes above 0
- `floor candidate: yes` when a floor plane is detected

This satisfies the Task S1 physical-device test in
`docs/plans/ghostmap-implementation-plan.md`: camera feed displays, the AR
session reaches tracking, the plane manager reports a floor candidate, and the
screen shows session state, notTrackingReason and camera pose.

## Tests run
- `GhostMap.Scanner.EditModeTests` — 4/4 passed.
- `GhostMap.Shared.Tests` — 156/156 passed in the same run. 160 total, 0 failed,
  0 skipped.
- `ScannerBuild.ConfigureXr` + `ScannerBuild.BuildScanner` — clean build
  succeeded.
- `xcodebuild -target Unity-iPhone -configuration Release -sdk iphoneos
  CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO` — BUILD SUCCEEDED; the linked binary contains the
  ARKit native symbols.
- Physical-device smoke test on a real iPhone — **passed** (above).

## Root cause of the first device failure — no active XR loader
`UNITY_XR_ARKIT_LOADER_ENABLED` was never present in the iOS scripting define
symbols, so:

1. Nearly all of `com.unity.xr.arkit` compiled to stubs. `ARKitSessionSubsystem`
   and friends register their subsystem descriptors only after
   `Api.AtLeast11_0()`, which the stub build hard-codes to false, so
   `ARKitLoader.Initialize()` found no descriptors, returned false, and XR
   Management never promoted it to the active loader.
2. `ARKitBuildProcessor.loaderEnabled` stayed false, so its plugin-copy delegate
   excluded `libUnityARKit.a` and `UnityARKit.m` from the Xcode project
   entirely.

The XR settings themselves were always correct and always shipped — iOS
`XRGeneralSettings` with `InitManagerOnStart`, an `XRManagerSettings` with
`ARKitLoader` assigned, all reaching the player's preloaded assets. That is why
the failure looked like a loader that was configured but inert.

The define is normally added by the ARKit package itself from
`UnityEditor.XR.ARKit.LoaderEnabledCheck`, which returns immediately in batch
mode and, in the Editor, only runs on a polling coroutine some time after the
loader is assigned. Its batch-mode fallback inside `ARKitBuildProcessor` is
itself wrapped in `#if UNITY_XR_ARKIT_LOADER_ENABLED`, so it can never bootstrap
the define from nothing. The scanner's build script had been assigning the
loader from inside `BuildPlayer`, which is far too late regardless: a scripting
define only reaches compiled code on the next script compilation.

Fixed by making XR configuration its own step, `ScannerBuild.ConfigureXr`.

## Root cause of the second device failure — camera pose never written
`ProjectSettings.asset` had `activeInputHandler: 0` (Active Input Handling =
Input Manager (Old)), so `ENABLE_INPUT_SYSTEM` was never defined and the Input
System backend was absent from the player. AR Foundation drives the AR camera
with `UnityEngine.InputSystem.XR.TrackedPoseDriver` bound to
`<HandheldARInputDevice>/devicePosition` and `/deviceRotation`. With no backend
there is no such device, the driver's actions resolve to zero controls,
`ReadTrackingStateWithoutTrackingAction()` yields `TrackingStates.None`, and
`SetLocalTransform` writes neither position nor rotation — so the camera sits at
its authored local pose regardless of how well ARKit tracks.

Proven from the failing player's own IL2CPP output: `InputSystemProvider`'s
static constructor, whose only statement is inside `#if ENABLE_INPUT_SYSTEM`,
was compiled down to `{ return; }`.

Everything else in that chain was verified correct first — the Transform the
diagnostics read, the XR Origin → Camera Offset → Main Camera hierarchy,
`XROrigin.Camera`, and the ARCameraManager / ARCameraBackground /
TrackedPoseDriver components with their bindings. See
`docs/handoffs/2026-09-12-scanner-s1-camera-pose-not-driven.md` for the
link-by-link table.

Active Input Handling is now "Both", set by `ScannerBuild.ConfigureXr`, and
`BuildScanner` refuses to build without `ENABLE_INPUT_SYSTEM`.

## Xcode 26 link defect found behind the first fix
Once `libUnityARKit.a` was actually linked, the Xcode project failed to link with
undefined `__swift_FORCE_LOAD_$_swiftCompatibility*` symbols. The ARKit package
points the linker at the Swift compatibility shims via `$(TOOLCHAIN_DIR)`, but
Xcode 26.6 prepends the separately delivered Metal toolchain to `TOOLCHAINS`, so
that resolves to a toolchain with no Swift runtime. `ScannerIosPostBuild` now
adds the correct `XcodeDefault.xctoolchain` paths as `-L` flags on
`OTHER_LDFLAGS`. This had been invisible because the broken builds never linked
the ARKit library at all.

## Interfaces consumed
- Available now from the frozen shared package. The scanner will consume from
  `com.ghostmap.shared`: `GhostCoordinateFrame`, `RayPlaneMath`, `RoomGeometry`,
  `RoomValidator`, `OpeningValidator`, `FurnitureValidator`, the domain DTOs, and
  `ProtocolSerializer`.

## Known issues
All of the following are **non-blocking**. None of them prevented the S1
physical-device test from passing.

### Build process
- Building the scanner for iOS is a **two-step** process and cannot be collapsed
  into one: `ScannerBuild.ConfigureXr`, then `ScannerBuild.BuildScanner` in a
  separate Unity invocation. Both `UNITY_XR_ARKIT_LOADER_ENABLED` and
  `ENABLE_INPUT_SYSTEM` only reach compiled code on the next script compilation.
  In the interactive Editor, the Active Input Handling change from step 1 needs
  an Editor restart. `BuildScanner` fails loudly rather than shipping a broken
  player if this is skipped.
- The generated Xcode project has no signing team. It must be selected by hand
  before deploying to a device.
- `ScannerIosPostBuild` carries an Xcode 26 workaround for the Apple ARKit XR
  Plug-in's `$(TOOLCHAIN_DIR)`-based Swift library search paths. Re-check
  whether it is still needed on an ARKit package or Xcode upgrade; it is
  additive, so it is harmless if the upstream issue is fixed.

### Scene / runtime, to settle in a later task
- `XROrigin.m_CameraYOffset` is `1.1176`, AR Foundation's own factory default
  (`XROriginCreateUtil.CreateXROriginWithParent` never sets it). ARKit reports
  `TrackingOriginModeFlags.Device`, so `XROrigin.MoveOffsetHeight()` applies
  that offset to Camera Offset and every camera world Y carries it. Deliberately
  left alone — it is unrelated to anything S1 tests, and the diagnostics report
  `Offset W` separately so the value is visible rather than hidden inside
  `Cam W`. **Decide it when S3 locks the floor.**
- `ScannerBootstrap`'s per-link diagnostics readout was built for S1 bring-up.
  It stays for now because S2-S6 device work will want it; replace it with the
  real capture UI when that UI exists.

### Toolchain warnings, stock noise
- `ld: warning: search path '.../Metal.xctoolchain/usr/lib/swift*/iphoneos' not
  found` (twice per link). These are the ARKit package's own `$(TOOLCHAIN_DIR)`
  entries that the `OTHER_LDFLAGS` workaround above compensates for. The link
  succeeds.
- Unity reports `Packages/com.unity.xr.arkit/Tests/Editor/Assets/TestReferenceImageLibrary.asset`
  as "unexpectedly altered" in an immutable package. That is the ARKit package's
  own test asset in the package cache, not anything in this repository.
- Unity logs `The application 'build-server' does not exist. / No .NET SDKs were
  found.` at the end of batch-mode runs. No system .NET SDK is installed; builds
  and tests succeed regardless.
- The usual Xcode deprecation and `has no symbols` warnings from Unity's own
  trampoline sources.

## Next safe task
- **S2.** S1 is complete and verified on hardware, so the scanner workstream may
  proceed to the next task in `docs/plans/ghostmap-implementation-plan.md`.

## Do not touch
- `shared/**`, `fixtures/**`, `tools/**`, `docs/contracts/**`, `docs/decisions/**`
  — owned by the Shared/Integration workstream.
